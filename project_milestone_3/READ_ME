The game is updated in a couple of ways.  The colors of the snake are changed to more comfortably adjust to the larger change of the 
project, the addition of a hazard. The snake is now green and is trying to acquire green segments while trying to avoid red segments.  
These red segments spawn randomly and appear more the larger the snake gets.
